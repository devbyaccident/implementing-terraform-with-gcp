Setup

SEtup application default credentials

`gcloud auth application-default login`

This will create a credential set under my config folder in my home dir.
I copied it to the root dir of this repo so we can see it easier.

Set up a service acc and get creds for it so we can impersonate it while we're calling terraform locally. (see README from m2/ dir)
